                        <p class="role pb-45 pt-20">1. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
                        </p>
                        <p class="job2 ptb-20"> <a href="https://cybertronlabs.com/devops">AI</a> isn’t futuristic —
                            it’s mainstream. From intelligent chatbots to

                        </p>
                        <p class="role pb-45 pt-20">2. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

                        <p class="job2 ptb-20"> PWAs blend the best of web and mobile apps. They load fast, work
                            offline, and offer seamless experiences across devices — all without requiring downloads
                            from app stores.

                        <p class="role pb-45 pt-20">4. Voice Search Optimization

                        </p>

                        <p class="job2 pb-30">With voice-enabled assistants becoming ubiquitous, optimizing websites for
                            voice search is essential to capture growing traffic from natural language queries.

                        <p class="role pb-45 pt-20">5. Jamstack & Modern Web Architecture

                        <p class="job2 pb-30">The Jamstack approach (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) delivers faster, more
                            secure sites by pre-rendering pages and leveraging CDNs.
